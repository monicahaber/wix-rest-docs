# Extended Fields

Site contributors and apps can add extended fields to a site’s Contact List.
Extended fields are used to store information important to a site owner’s business,
beyond what is stored in the default fields.
Extended fields can store data as text, number, date, or URL,
and they can have any name they choose.
Any new extended fields can be used for all contacts in the Contact List.

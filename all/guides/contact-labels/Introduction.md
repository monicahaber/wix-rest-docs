# Contact Labels

Contact labels allow site contributors to segment contacts in their Contact List.
Contact labels are useful for targeting specific audiences
for email campaigns or bulk actions.

The contact label APIs let site contributors list and manage contact labels.
The responses can be used to query contacts in downstream API requests.
